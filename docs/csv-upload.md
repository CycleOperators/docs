# Quickly add canisters in bulk using CSV upload

Our [CSV upload feature](https://cycleops.dev/app/personal/csv-upload-canisters) allows you to quickly and easily add hundreds of canisters to your CycleOps account while controlling configuration for each canister including:

- Canister ID
- Canister name
- Automated top-up rules
- Tags
- Project

Our [CSV upload feature](https://cycleops.dev/app/personal/csv-upload-canisters) automatically detects columns for you, so you don't need to follow a strict format when creating your input.

## Get Started

To access this feature, click on the dropdown next to the "Add Canister" button and select "CSV Upload".

To begin, simply drag and drop your CSV, or paste it into the text box. You will be prompted to confirm that your CSV input has been mapped correctly. Keep the browser window open during the opload process to avoid interupting the operation.
