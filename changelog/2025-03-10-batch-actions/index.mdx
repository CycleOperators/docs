Today we’re releasing even more tools to make it easier to manage your canisters. Batch actions have been live for a few weeks now, but with this release you can now change top-up rules, setup memory alerting, finalize canister setup, or perform a one-time top-up for hundreds of canisters at a time.

All you need to do is select a bunch of canisters, open the command prompt (⌘ + K) or right click, and choose which action you want to perform. Just one more thing we’re doing to make CycleOps the best possible home for your canisters.

### What we built

Did you know that you can right click your canisters to perform quick actions? The new CycleOps UI is built to be as intuitive as possible for canister newbies, and to provide flexible and fast tooling for power users. Today we are expanding these quick action menus with even more commands.

#### New Actions

- **Top-up now:** Perform an immediate one-time top-up on a batch of selected canisters.
- **Set top-up rule:** Configure the automatic top-up rule for a batch of selected canisters.
- **Add memory alert:** Configure an email alert to be sent when a memory threshold is crossed for any of the selected canisters.
