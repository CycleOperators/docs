We’ve shipped a broad set of mobile UX improvements across CycleOps — the takeaway is simple:

**CycleOps is now genuinely easy to use on your phone.**

<!-- truncate -->

Whether you’re checking cycles balances, responding to an alert, or doing a quick top-up, you can now do it comfortably on the go.

## What we shipped

A sweep of mobile-focused fixes across the CycleOps web app, including:

- Cleaner navigation and page layouts on small screens
- More usable tables, charts, and dashboards on mobile
- Improved forms and action flows (top-ups, canister actions, etc.)
- Better tap targets, spacing, and readability across the app

(If you’ve ever tried to do “real work” in a mobile browser and bounced — this release is specifically aimed at that.)

## Why it matters

CycleOps is operational tooling. And operational tooling is most valuable when you’re _not_ at your desk.

This update turns a bunch of “I’ll deal with it later” moments into “handled in 20 seconds”:

- You notice something looks off → you can check it immediately.
- You’re mid-day, mid-errand, mid-anything → you can still take action.
- You want confidence that everything’s healthy → you can get it from your pocket.

## How you can use it

Open CycleOps on your phone and try the “real” workflows:

- Check cycles balances while you’re out at lunch
- Do a quick top-up during a walk or workout
- Deploy or manage a canister when you’re away from your laptop
- Keep building on ICP (and keep your canisters healthy) wherever you are

If you’ve never used CycleOps before: it’s a proactive canister management layer for the Internet Computer — monitoring, alerts, and top-ups — designed to reduce operational overhead and prevent surprise outages.
