Today we're releasing the ability to create new canister smart contracts in seconds, and to manage them directly from your CycleOps dashboard.

No terminal. No `dfx canister create ...<what args next?>`. Just a few clicks.

## What we shipped

CycleOps now lets you create and manage Internet Computer canisters without ever leaving your browser. Add a canister and click “Create New” to:
- Create a canister on any subnet—including low‑latency, high‑storage, or fiduciary subnets.
- Pre‑load it with the exact number of cycles you choose.
- Add one or more controllers (your dfx principal, teammates, or service canisters).
- Manage lifecycle actions: start, stop, and delete.
- Tweak settings on the fly: controllers, freezing threshold, reserved cycles.
- Snapshot, restore, and stream live logs—straight from the UI.

## Why we built it

Creating canisters has typically meant juggling `dfx`, ledger transfers, and guessing which subnet will serve you best. That process costs time and invites mistakes:

- **Speed:** Spin up a production‑ready canister in seconds.
- **Safety:** Clear UI prevents accidental under‑funding or wrong‑subnet deploys.
- **Scale:** Fleet owners can keep all canisters—old and new—visible and actionable in one place.

CycleOps already monitors and tops‑up thousands of canisters; now it can create and manage them, too

## How you can use it

1. Open **Canisters → New Canister** in your CycleOps dashboard.
2. Pick the subnet that suits your use case. Need low latency? Choose one of our fast‑lane subnets. Want high node count for fiduciary workloads? That option’s there too.
3. Enter an initial cycles balance—CycleOps will transfer the cycles and confirm allocation.
4. Add controllers (paste principal IDs or pick from your org’s members).
5. Click **Create**. In a few seconds your new canister appears in the dashboard.

## Managing Created Canisters

After creating a canister, you can manage it by clicking on a canister and then navigating to its “Manage” tab. From here, you can:

- Start/stop the canister as needed.
- Adjust settings and controllers anytime.
- Snapshots: create a point‑in‑time state backup and roll back with one click.
- Watch live logs while you iterate.
